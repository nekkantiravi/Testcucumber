    And I add a "FST_product" product to my bag
    And I navigate to shopping bag page
    And I set "<qty_1>" in the shopping bag page
    And I verify order sub total is more than "<segment_value>"
    Then I should see free shipping promotion applied in "shopping bag"
    And I set "<qty_2>" in the shopping bag page
    And I verify order sub total is less than "<segment_value>"
    Then I should not see free shipping promotion applied in "shopping bag"
