The website photo can hardly do them justice. \n\nThe opening of the Doctors/Weekender bag makes it easy to pack and another great surprise was that the bottom portion of the bag is it's own seperate zipper compartment with room for at least three pairs of nice shoes, toiletries or a good place to put swimsuits etc at the end of your trip.  The fact that it also has built in wheels and can be rolled when things get heavy is another nice benefit. It's the perfect size.

My year-long search for luggage ended as soon as I stumbled on this collection. I love all of the inner compartments that address the needs of a modern lifestyle. The contemporary styling is fresh, simple, stylish and sophisticated and has a clean, unisex look as well. Its got personality yet is understated at the same time. The luggage itself has a a nice weight to it, so it's not too heavy to begin with. The ergonomic handle is a pleasure. And the functionality of the pieces--the backpack and upright--really ensure everything has its place and helps manage all the moving parts of life when traveling. It's refreshing to see well-chosen, well-made materials coupled with well-thought-out design. I also appreciate it being offered in the dark brown \"Tobacco\" colour in addition to standard black. Finally, the fact that Samsonite is a compnany that offers lifetime-warranties on its products gives me a certain confidence in them as a consumer. I'm happy to invest in a purchase from manufacturers who stand behind the quality of the products they make. 2 Thumbs up!","ContextDataValues":{"id2":{"Value":"No","Id":"id2","ValueLabel":"No","DimensionLabel":"Are you a Macy's Credit Card holder?"},"id1":{"Value":"Firsttime","Id":"id1","ValueLabel":"First time","DimensionLabel":"How often do you shop at macys.com?"}},"ProductId":"185599","Videos":[],"CommentIds":[],"Photos":[],"TotalNegativeFeedbackCount":0,"RatingRange":5,"UserLocation":"City of Angels, CA","CampaignId":null,"SecondaryRatingsOrder":[],"TotalCommentCount":0,"ContextDataValuesOrder":["id1","id2"],"ClientResponses":[],"TagDimensionsOrder":[],"TotalPositiveFeedbackCount":0,"IsRatingsOnly":false,"LastModificationTime":"2006-10-02T15:30:18.000+00:00","Pros":null,"ProductRecommendationIds":[],"BadgesOrder":["featured"],"AuthorId":"648299180","Helpfulness":null,"SubmissionTime":"2006-09-30T18:55:22.000+00:00","AdditionalFields":{},"Title":"Form Marries Function Beautifully, Successfully","TotalFeedbackCount":0,"AdditionalFieldsOrder":[],"ModerationStatus":"APPROVED","IsFeatured":true,"Cons":null,"TagDimensions":{},"SecondaryRatings":{},"Badges":{"featured":{"ContentType":"REVIEW","Id":"featured","BadgeType":"Custom"}},"IsSyndicated":false,"SubmissionId":null,"IsRecommended":true,"LastModeratedTime":"2006-10-02T15:30:18.000+00:00","Id":"204727","ContentLocale":"en_US"}],"TotalResults":44309,"Limit":8,"HasErrors":false,"Offset":0}
